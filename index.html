        <h1>Intermittent</h1>
        <p>The intermittent interaction is not continuous and not proactive. The interaction is initiated by the user providing an explicit request and terminated when the system has delivered on the request.<br><br>
          For example, an intelligent system that suggest music to play when requested by the user.</p><br>

      </div>
      <div class="middle">
        <h1>Continuous</h1>
        <p>The continuous interaction typically have a longer time duration. The interaction is a process rather than a single task, in which the user and the system are actively collaborating, exchanging information and coordinating actions.<br><br>
          For example, an AI that continually support users who are actively exploring new music.</p><br>
        <button class="button-big" type="button" onclick="window.location.href='./continuous.html';">Try demo</button>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <h1>Proactive</h1>
        <p>The proactive interaction is initiated by the system, not by the user. The interaction will be triggered by a sensor or change in internal system state, resulting in a system response. The user may or may not be aware or react to the interference of AI.<br><br>
          For example, an AI that automatically play appropriate music to match the mood of the users.
